The first account has been recovered by the rightful owner. We would
like to take the opportunity and let the public know the procedure.

**Note: If your owner key has not been compromised, you can recover your
account on your own and do not need to go through below procedure!**

1. Prove of ownership - this was performed by means of a signed message
   using the bitshares-ui and previously used and non-compromised memo
   keys.
2. The signed message contains new active and owner keys
3. Agreement on finder's fee - local law applies which grants us a
   finders fee of 3% of the total value in the account.
4. Transfer of funds to `random-k.com` account in BTS
5. Adding of additional keys to the account
6. The rightful owner to remove `random-k.com` from account permissions.

With this transparency in place, we hope the wider community understands
and accepts our service.
