As of January 22nd, we have identified 335 private keys that are
compromised. A total of 310 accounts are at least partially affected.

You can identify if your account is affected by looking for
the `random-k.com` authority in your active permission of your account.

In that case, we highly recommend your obtain new keys, replace
`random-k.com` with your own keys and closely watch for the report
produced by [hackthedex](https://hackthedex.io).
