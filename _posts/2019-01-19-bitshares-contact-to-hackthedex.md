We have made contact to [hackthedex](https://hackthedex.io/) and are looking to
work more closely together with them in order to resolve this issue.

As a remark, it appears, the root cause of this issue has been identified.
More details will be published as soon as we can be sure it cannot be used
by fraudulent 3rd parties to steal funds.

Most BitShares users are not affected.
